# Embedded Systems development Firmware in C/C++ 

## IMPORTANT

**This environment is under construction!!**

**Always use the [released versions](../../releases) because in these all examples are tested and the API documentation is consistent. The master branch may contain inconsistencies because this environment is currently under development. See the Travis CI tag above to know the status of this repository.**

## Supported boards

- [CIAA-NXP (LPC4337)](documentation/CIAA_Boards/NXP_LPC4337/CIAA-NXP/CIAA-NXP%20v1.0%20Board%20-%202019-01-04%20v3r0.pdf).

## Supported toolchains

- gcc-arm-none-eabi 

## Usage

- Make sure you have an `arm-none-eabi-*` toolchain configured in your `PATH`. If you don't have it, download [GCC ARM Embedded](https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm).
- Make sure you have an `openocd` configured in your `PATH`.

### Select a target board to compile

- Create a `board.mk` text file inside this folder.
- Define `BOARD` variable in `board.mk` according to the board you want to compile.

**`board.mk` example default values:**

```makefile
BOARD = edu_ciaa_nxp
```

Note: If you have `zenity` installed (included in [CIAA Software](https://github.com/epernia/software/)), you can use:

- `make select_board` to select graphically a target board.

![Select board](documentation/README/select_board.png)

This will create automaticaly a `board.mk` text file inside this folder with the selected board.

### Select a program to compile

- Create a `program.mk` text file inside this folder.
- Define `PROGRAM_NAME`  and `PROGRAM_PATH` variables in `program.mk` according to the program you want to compile (PROGRAM_PATH is relative to this folder, leave void if the program is inside this folder).

**`program.mk` example default values:**

```makefile
PROGRAM_PATH = examples/c
PROGRAM_NAME = app
```

Note: If you have `zenity` installed, you can use:

- `make select_program` to select graphically a program.

![Select program](documentation/README/select_program.png)

This will create automaticaly a `program.mk` text file inside this folder with the selected program.

### Compile and download

- Compile with `make`.
- Download to target via OpenOCD with `make download`.
- Clean compilation with `make clean`.

### Create a new program

Each program consist in a folder (with a non-spaces name) that includes inside 2 folders, one named ```src``` (here go, .c, .cpp or .s source code files), and another one named ```inc``` (here go, .h or .hpp source header files). 

`program.c` example:

```c
#include "sapi.h"
int main( void )
{
   boardInit();
   while(1){
      gpioToggle(LED);
      delay(200);
   }
}
```

`program.h` example:

```c
#ifndef __ARCHIVO_H_
#define __ARCHIVO_H_
   // Your public declarations...
#endif
```

Also you can use a file named `config.mk`, where you may configure which libraries you include and compiler options.

`config.mk` example and default values:

```makefile
# Compile options
VERBOSE=n
OPT=g
USE_NANO=y
SEMIHOST=n
USE_FPU=y
# Libraries
USE_LPCOPEN=y
USE_SAPI=y
```

Program complete structure is:

```
+program
+--config.mk
+--+src
|  +--program.c
+--+inc
   +--program.h
```

Note: If you have `zenity` installed, you can use:

- `make new_program` to create graphically a program using program templates.

![New program](documentation/README/new_program.png)

First time will ask you for your user preferences:

![User preferences](documentation/README/user_preferences.png)

### Create a new global library

The `libs` folder include libraries that can be used fom any program (global libraries).

The `Makefile` allow you to include 2 types of libraries:

- Simple library. Consist in a folder (with a non-spaces name) that includes inside 2 folders, one named ```src``` (here go .c, .cpp or .s source code files), and another one named ```inc``` (here go .h or .hpp header files). This kind of library compiles automaticaly by the Makefile.
- Advanced library. Consist in a library with a complex folder and files structure, i.e. LibUSB. This case require make your own makefile. You can inspire from sAPI makefile to do that.
